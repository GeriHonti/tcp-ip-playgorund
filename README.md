# tcp-ip-playgorund
A simple TCP/IP client and server console application. 

A TCP/IP client and server application is a type of network application that uses the TCP/IP protocol suite to establish communication between two or more computers over a network. 
The server application listens for incoming connection requests from client applications, while the client application initiates the connection to the server. 
Once the connection is established, the client and server exchanges the data by sending and receiving TCP/IP packets.

This type of application is commonly used for tasks such as file sharing, messaging, remote control, and real-time data streaming.

In this solution there is a console application emulating the server on localhost and a client.
